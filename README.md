# Voice Deepfake Detection – Take-Home Assessment (Momenta)

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting voice deepfakes using machine learning techniques. Voice deepfakes pose serious risks such as impersonation, misinformation, and fraud. The objective is to implement and evaluate a deepfake detection approach and provide insights into its performance and future improvements.

## Model Selection

*Chosen Model*: [Your Model Name – e.g., Wav2Vec2, RawNet2, or Custom CNN]

*Reason for Selection*:
- [Explain why you chose this model – e.g., pre-trained availability, performance on previous benchmarks, suitability for small datasets, etc.]

---

## Dataset

*Used Dataset*: [e.g., ASVspoof2019 (LA subset), WaveFake, Fake-or-Real]

*Details*:
- Number of samples used: [e.g., 100 real, 100 fake]
- Preprocessing: [e.g., Resampled to 16kHz, trimmed to 3 seconds, normalized]

---

## Implementation Steps

1. *Data Preparation*
   - Downloaded and loaded audio data
   - Preprocessed using librosa (e.g., converted to Mel spectrogram / raw waveform)

2. *Model Setup*
   - Loaded [pretrained model or defined architecture]
   - Defined training loop / inference function

3. *Training / Evaluation*
   - Trained for [number of epochs] or evaluated on test split
   - Used accuracy / AUC / F1-score as metrics

---

## Results

| Metric     | Value         |
|------------|---------------|
| Accuracy   | [e.g., 88.5%] |
| AUC Score  | [Optional]    |
| Inference Speed | [e.g., 20ms/sample] |

## Challenges Faced

- [Example: Audio clips had varied lengths, needed to pad/trim]
- [Example: GPU constraints for training large models]
- [Example: Dataset imbalance between real and fake samples]

---

## Future Improvements

- Use larger and more diverse datasets (e.g., real-world spoofed calls)
- Experiment with model ensembles
- Add noise robustness and adversarial training
- Deploy as a real-time detection tool or API

---

## Conclusion

This implementation shows that voice deepfake detection can be approached effectively using audio-based models like [Model Name]. Despite limitations in time and compute, this project provides a solid foundation for scalable and production-level anti-deepfake solutions.
